## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-cli)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

### Quick Start

Run the following in your favorite terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/danielccunha/coronavirus-map
cd coronavirus-map
yarn develop
```

### Starting from Scratch

- Set up [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
- Install the Gatsby CLI globally:

```sh
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

- Inside the directory of your choice, scaffold a new Gatsby site:

```
gatsby new [directory] https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-leaflet
```

For example, if I want my installation in `~/Code/new-gatsby-site`, I would navigate to `~/Code` and run:

```
gatsby new new-gatsby-site https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-leaflet
```

- Navigate to your new directory and run:

```
yarn develop
```

- You should now be running a new Gatsby site locally using Leaflet starter project! 🎉
